# MonoSSG
Hello everyone, thank you for your interest in this repo. I am working on releasing the code, but no guarantee when the code will be released. ~~The network training code will be released faster, probably in the [3DSSG repo](https://github.com/ShunChengWu/3DSSG) (with a tag or something).~~ **Update**: The python code has been pushed to the [3DSSG repo](https://github.com/ShunChengWu/3DSSG/tree/main).

There are many reasons why I can't release the code soon. I am in the "finishing period" of my Ph.D. and have no funding so I need to do something else to keep myself alive. Also, the machine I used for this work has been (partially) taken for a greater purpose. All of those hinder my progress in releasing the code.
